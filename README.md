# pytorch-deep-painterly-harmonization
Pytorch implementation of the Deep Painterly Harmonisation paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03189

This repo is no longer in development as some of the CUDA code of the original repository is proving to be too difficult and time consuming to reproduce. It also seems that certain parameter tuning and model selection is very crucial to reaching the same level of results. Thus I am no longer developing this as it is not worth my time.
